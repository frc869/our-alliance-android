  <p>This is a scouting app for teams to use in the FIRST Robotics Competition, it is able to store scouting info on each team for the season. Each competition has a separate list of teams for each competition however scouting information will cross between competitions in each season. There is a rudimentary match list where teams can organize who is in each match and quickly lookup team info. There is also an experimential feature to export the data to a CSV and able to be opened with any CSV viewing application for android. Multimedia is stored on an external sdcard and stored again by season then by team.</p>
