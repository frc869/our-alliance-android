  <h2>Developed by: <a href="http://mechinn.com">Michael Chinn</a></h2>
  <p>This is a scouting app for teams to use in the FIRST Robotics Competition, it will be able to store scouting info on each team and record information about each team&rsquo;s performance throughout matches in the competition. The plan is to allow multiple android devices to sync with each other.</p>
  <p>No syncing right now but functionally it should be able to serve as a scouting app if you are a team going to an off season event!</p>
